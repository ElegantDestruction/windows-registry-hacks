# Windows Registry Hacks
Call me a snob, but there's lots of stupid little things I like to change about Windows 10 on a fresh install. This script is simply a compilation of all of those little things that happen to require a registry hack. This includes things like:

* Disabling the lock screen cover
* Enabling verbose startup and shutdown
* Removing the 3D objects folder from "This PC"
* Disabling Wallpaper Compression for .jpegs
* Adding an option to open every file with Notepad
* Disabling the outdated SMBv1 protocol for security
* Enabling "Last-Active-Click" for window switching
* Showing seconds in the taskbar clock

To run, simply download the All\_Reg\_Hacks.reg and run it.
